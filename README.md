# Pizzeria-Database

This project is a relational database designed for a pizzeria to manage daily operations, including customer orders, inventory usage, and labor costs. The database models real-world relationships between menu items, recipes, ingredients, employees, and shifts. I used custom SQL queries to track order volume, calculate ingredient consumption and costs, monitor inventory levels, and determine employee labor costs per shift. The project demonstrates practical database design, data aggregation, and cost analysis using SQL.

## Tech Stack/Technologies
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench

## Queries
- Order Activity
  - Allows you to view order activity. This includes the order id and time the order was created, the price, quantity, category, and name of the items in the order, and the delivery address.
- Inventory Management
  - Allows you to view how much inventory has been used to identify what needs reordering and how much each pizza costs to make.
- Staff
